         <p><strong><span class="intro">A recipe is full of quantities, measurements, and instructions, but it's not just a formula.</span></strong> Often, it's a memory - of that week you were in Florence, or of your mom baking cookies, or of your homeland across the world. Which is to say:Often, it's personal.</p>

         <h4><em>Description</em></h4>
         <p>This sandwich is called a <span class="name">'Media Noche'</span> which translates to 'Midnight.' It makes a wonderful dinner sandwich because it is served hot. A nice side dish is black bean soup or black beans and rice, and plantain chips.</p>
